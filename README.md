# What Universities do students prefer?

This notebook is a short analysis of the factors that affect students' choice of University.

The basic questions we want to answer are:
* Do students prefer Universities with a higher number of applications?
* Do students favor public or private Universities? 
* Are students interested in continuing their studies by choosing Universities that offer higher degrees?

To answer the first query we have to compare the number of applications to the number of admissions and the number of admissions to the number of enrollments.

As we can see in both graphs, both values increase at the same time. That doesn't mean that the more applications a University receives, the more students enroll. As we see below, the lower the number of admissions, the higher the enrollment rate. So we conclude that the number of applications doesn't play an important role when choosing University.

The next question we want to answer is if students want to go to public or private Universities.

As we see above students prefer to go to public Universities as the enrollment rate is higher than for the private Universities.

The last questions is if students want to continue studing by choosing Universities that offer higher degrees.

As we see students enroll in Universitires that offer Bachelor's and Master's degree for the most part, so they don't want to continue studing at the same University after their degree is over.
